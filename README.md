# Ficket Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Ficket algorithm, an efficient method for identifying exons and introns in gene sequences. Exons are regions of DNA that code for proteins, while introns are non-coding regions that are removed during RNA splicing. Accurately distinguishing between these regions is crucial for understanding gene expression and function.

## Features

- **Accurate Exon-Intron Detection**: The algorithm uses sequence characteristics to predict the locations of exons and introns in a given DNA sequence.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can adjust key parameters to tailor the algorithm to specific datasets or experimental conditions.
- **Simple Interface**: Easy-to-use functions for integrating the algorithm into bioinformatics pipelines.

## Acknowledgments

The Ficket algorithm was originally described in original paper. This implementation is based on that work and aims to make it accessible for Python users.
